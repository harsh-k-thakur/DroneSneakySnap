  This code sets up the ATmega128RFA1's wireless transciever in
  the most basic way possible to serve as a serial gateway.
  Serial into the ATmega128RFA1's UART0 will go out the RF radio.
  Data into the RF radio will go out the MCU's UART0.

  // Send a message to other RF boards on this channel
