Questions from Sample Check LIst

1. Antenna and Antenna Driver
	Will the copper DW close to the antenna cause interferece? According to me yes.

2. Power and Ground
	a. The VBAT and BAT_GND, around motors is less than 3mm, if you dont require current there you can just make your two layers small.

3. IMU
	Everthing looks good for this section

4. Headers
	a. No names gives to breakout header. No silkscreen labels on your programming header

5. Microcontroller
	Everthing looks good for this section

6. Power Supply
	2V5 power plane is not under the voltage regulator

7. Motor Drivers
	Everthing looks good for this section

8. Aesthetics
	a. Board looks fine, but increasing the thickness at the end of the board where motors connects, would help you survive the damage.
	b. Reference designators overlaps near IMU, microcontroller and volatage regulator, try if you can make it work. Names and values for C12 and nearby capacitors are a mess, same for C16. C1 and C2 labels will be hidden by the parts you're placing there

9. Mechanical
	a. Grommet ring to board connection is very thin, are you sure it'll withstand a crash?

10. LEDs
	Everthing looks good for this section		

11. Checks
	I think there is a blob under antenna which is not required.
