Questions from Sample Check LIst

1. Antenna and Antenna Driver
	Everthing looks good for this section

2. Power and Ground
	a. The VBAT and BAT_GND, around motors is less than 3mm, if you dont require current there you can just make your two layers small.
	b. Also you have less than 3mm around your mounting hole towards the board. I don't know if this going to create an issue(we can confirm with professor).
	c. PWM4 line cuts the layer 15 into two planes.

3. IMU

4. Headers
	a. No names gives to breakout header.

5. Microcontroller

6. Power Supply
	2V5 power plane is not under the voltage regulator

7. Motor Drivers
	Everthing looks good for this section
	Can you check thickness of nets the motor driver for me (Rye)!

8. Aesthetics
	a. Board looks fine, but increasing the thickness at the end of the board where motors connects, would help you survive the damage.
	b. Reference designators overlaps near IMU, microcontroller and volatage regulator, try if you can make it work.

9. Mechanical

10. LEDs
	

11. Checks
	I think there is a blob under antenna which is not required.
