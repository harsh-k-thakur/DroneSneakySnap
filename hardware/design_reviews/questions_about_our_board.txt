Sample Checklist
****************

Is the trace between the balun and the antenna short (no longer than the corresponding trace in the reference design)?
--> Eaglint wants 6mm, did this pass the auto check?

Is it okay for the antenna to be not on the edge of the board?
--> Signal integrity may be compromised by electrical parts around it, particularly the two parts of the board below the antenna

Should the cutout include part of the MCU?
--> Discussed with us during class

Is the FTDI header oriented so the silkscreen is labels for the pins are on the board and the pins will protrude off the board?
--> Not close to the edge of the board

Does the layout look nice?
--> You can make layer 2 and 15 pours cover the whole board, otherwise the color will be different near the propellor

Double check header orientation
--> Looks different than ours, not sure if that matters

Mechanical ring width
--> Width is 3.2mm, which is much thicker than requirement (1.7mm). Could make it thinner for better propellor clearance.

**********
DRC CHECKS
**********

Trace width error was approved for the balun
--> On ADRV pin in B1, the trace width underneath is much bigger than Professor's video example

Trace width error on pin 58 for the MCU
--> Maybe rewire that pin

****
LEDS
****

24 extra LEDS might be super bright if they can't be dimmed
--> Maybe consider a potentiometer to control brightness
--> Also, resistors are calculated based on max VBAT (4.2V)
